# ORION
ORION is an offensive Recon tool focused on decision-making. It automates attack surface enumeration, correlates technical data, and uses intelligence to prioritize targets, reduce noise, and explain why an asset is relevant, helping pentesters and bug bounty hunters focus on what actually matters.
